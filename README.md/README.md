## Project Overview
This project analyzes outpatient clinic appointment data to identify patterns in appointment attendance and no-show behavior using Microsoft Excel.

## Stakeholders
- Clinic operations managers
- Department leadership
- Scheduling and access-to-care teams

## Business Question
Which clinics and departments experience the highest appointment no-show rates and should be prioritized for targeted interventions?

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Verified no duplicate records
- Standardized text formatting and corrected spelling
- Validated clinic categories (Clinic A–D)
- Created a binary no-show flag for analysis
- Final dataset includes 60 appointments

## Analysis
Pivot tables were used to summarize appointment volume and calculate no-show rates by clinic and department.

## Key Findings
- Overall no-show rate: 15%
- Clinic C had the highest clinic-level no-show rate (21%)
- Psychiatry within Clinic C showed the highest departmental no-show rate (40%) despite lower appointment volume

## Assumptions
- All appointments were treated equally
- No-show flag accurately reflects attendance status

## Limitations
- Small sample size limits generalizability
- No patient demographic data available

## Next Steps
- Recreate this analysis using SQL
- Expand analysis with additional metrics and visualizations
